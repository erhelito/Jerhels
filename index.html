        <h1>Music therapy, a revolutionary science?</h1>
        <h3>Music therapy is an on-trend practice, healing with music. How does it work? Is it reliable? We investigated for you.</h3>

        <div class="p1">
            <h2>What is music therapy?</h2>

            <p>Music therapy is a medical practice, which use music to heal. It is mainly used to psychiatric pains, to relax, gain self-confidence…<br>Music was studied during long time in old civilizations, like Greek or Hebrew civilizations. It was studied as a science, in the same way as mathematics, physics… But, those works on music were abandoned during a long time. In the XIX century, those researches were resumed. With new technologies, like electroencephalogram, we observed music’s effect on the brain. Below, you can see a map of the brain, showing its stimulation with and without music.</p>
            
            <div class="image-div">
                <img class="image" src="img/1.png">
                <i class="legend">Brain activity without music (above), and with music (below). A warm color indicates an intense activity.</i>
            </div>

            <p>We can notice that music stimulate the brain a lot, and in many sections. Practicing an instrument increase this stimulation. For example, we can see on this graph that persons which practice music have more grey matter than persons without musical skills. We can also see that professionals musicians have more grey matter than hobbyists.</p>

                <img class="image" src="img/2.png">
                <i class="legend">Grey matter volume, depending on musical skills. Squares represent non musicians, triangles hobbyists, circles professional musicians.</i>
            </div>

            <p>Type of music matters too. For example, pianos sounds stimulate the brain differently than violins sounds (waves represent electrical activity in the brain).</p>

        <div class="p2">
            <h2>2 different methods</h2>

            <p>Music therapy use those various studies to propose the bests musics, which suit to the illness. We can distinguish two methods: the active one, and the receptive one. The active way refers to instrument practice, according to Hervé Platel, a neuropsychologist. The receptive way refers to relaxation, meditation, while listening to music. Hervé Platel says that the active way favour communication, feeling expression, and the receptive way is used for pains, anxieties, depressions… So, music pull attention away, allowing a discussion with the therapist.</p>

        <div class="p3">
            <h2>Reliability of music therapy</h2>

            <p>While writing this article, we noticed that there are few articles about music therapy which quote scientific researches. As in some sites, music therapy can heal serious diseases, like cancers… That's why we warn you: music therapy can be useful for anxieties, calm some autism disorders, it can make you happy… But, music therapy can in no case heal serious diseases. For example, according to Hervé Platel, music therapy can delay neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer) progression, but it can’t stop its progression (contrary to what some websites deal with).<br>Currently, music therapy is limited to a low scope, never forget that in case of health problem, you have to see a doctor, a professional.</p>

            <h2>Music therapy for concentration</h2>

            <p>While writing this article, it was difficult for us to focus. That's why we'll deal with the effects of music therapy on focusing, and how music can help us. For that, we have to separate tasks in 2 categories: the easy/repetitive ones, and the more complex tasks, asking for more focusing. The scientist Manuel Gonzalez created so an experiment. He proposed to volunteer different tasks, more or less difficult. According to this study, music can help for the easiest tasks, making you more efficient, but, as a general rule, there is no big difference with or without music. However, for a more complex task, music make you less efficient, pulling attention away. According to Manuel Gonzalez, those results depend a lot on people mentality. Indeed, results vary from one individual to another.<br>As we wrote above, musics type vary results too. Lyrics, sudden instrument entrance, high and bright frequencies pull attention away. You have to choose rather musics more calm, with smooths transitions, deeper tones… Here again, people’s personality and tastes can change results. As Manuel Gonzalez said, music therapy is not “one-size-fits-all”.<br>So, you have to determine if your using of music is right, and you have to find the type of music which suit you.</p>
